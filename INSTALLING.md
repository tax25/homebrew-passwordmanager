# Installing passwordmanager

As of today passwordmanager is only available for macOS, which goes against what said in the README that this is for terminal-only OSs. But it's still in development and I still need to make a lot of experience, but it will be available 
even for linux in the near future. 

So installing passwordmanager on mac is really easy, we use homebrew. [Here to how to install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

You just have to: 

'''

brew tap tax25/homebrew-passwordmanager
brew install passwordmanager

'''
