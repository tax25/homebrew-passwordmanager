# homebrew-passwordmanager
A terminal password generator / manager.

# Why this project?

I started building this project basically to understand how to work with classes and sqlite3 in C++.

# Who is this for?

This password generator / manager is mainly for who has a terminal based OS (like on a raspberry and such boards), where we don't have
the fancy GUIs that we have elsewhere.
